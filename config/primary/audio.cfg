// - 0% - Physically Accurate (default): Physically modeled sound panning behavior most accurately reflecting the emitter position.
// - 100% - Isolated L/R: Sound emitters that are directly to the side of the player will be hard panned with minimal blending into the opposite L/R channel. This provides a strong sense of left vs right but can be positionally misleading at certain angles to the listener. For players who prefer legacy sound panning behaviour.
