// I recommend figuring out your eDPI and then changing your
// mouse DPI to its highest and adjusting your sensitivity.
// It's better for the game engine to get more precise data
// and then scale it down to your sensitivity than it is for
// your DPI to be low and your sensitivity to be high.
// At worst the difference won't be noticeable at all and at
// best it'll feel much smoother aiming in-game without any
// harm to muscle memory, the effect is similar to when you
// change from 60hz to a high refresh rate 144hz monitor,
// your muscle memory is the same you just get more data
// in-between than you did before.
// sensitivity * DPI = eDPI
// eDPI / yourMousesHighestPossibleDPI = newSensitivty
